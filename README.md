State your case in the form above. Be precise and concise. If someone has wronged you, state that person's name clearly. I will consider each and every case and mete out judgement accordingly! Some judgements are quick, others take time. I know best. This I promise: Perfect justice will be served to all — the living and the dead!!

    <br><br>

<p>You will have to account for your words and deeds.</p>
<p>If my investigations show that your appeal is groundless, be prepared for double the trouble!!</p>
