State your case in the box on the right. Be precise and concise. If someone has wronged you, state that person's name clearly. I will consider each and every case and mete out judgement accordingly! Some judgements are quick, others take time. I know best. This I promise: Perfect justice will be served to all â€” the living and the dead!!
